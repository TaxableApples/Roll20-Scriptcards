# Roll20-Scriptcards

Scriptcards is an API for Roll20 developed by Kurt Jaegers, for scriptcards tutorials and examples see his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kurtjaegers265) and [GitHub Page](https://github.com/kjaegers/ScriptCards)
    
Usage Documentation can be found [here](https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:ScriptCards)

**Requirements:**
-You must have a Roll20 Pro Account.
-Install both the Scriptcards API and the TokenMod API into your game in the API MOD Menu.

**Usage**
-I recommend adding these Macros as Token Actions on a Player's Character Sheet, in the Attributes & Abilities Section, under Abilities.

-The macros I share will be compatable with Dungeons & Dragons 5e ruleset, and will include content from the [V5.1 Systems Reference Document (including Creative Commons)](https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf)

**About This Project**
I'm not going to make every spell, but I wanted to make a library of complete macros for spells that are either thematically fun, or useful to speed up combat in Roll20. I have a ToDo list file and will cross off spells as I finish them.

Happy dungeon crawling!
