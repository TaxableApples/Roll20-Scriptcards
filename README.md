Scriptcards is an API for Roll20 developed by Kurt Jaegers, for scriptcards tutorials and examples see his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kurtjaegers265) and [GitHub Page](https://github.com/kjaegers/ScriptCards)
    
Usage Documentation can be found [here](https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:ScriptCards)

**Requirements:**
-You must have a Roll20 Pro Account.
-Install the Following APIs into your game in the API MOD Menu: Scriptcards, TokenMod and Supernotes.

**Usage**
-Macros can be pasted into the chat, and if you have the required APIs installed in Roll20, the script will execute.

-I recommend adding these Macros as Token Actions on a Player's Character Sheet, in the Attributes & Abilities Section, under Abilities.

-The macros I share will be compatable with Dungeons & Dragons 5e ruleset, and will include content from the D&D 5e [V5.1 Systems Reference Document (including Creative Commons)](https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf)

**About This Project**
I'm not going to make every spell, but I wanted to make a library of macros for attacks and spells that are either thematically fun, or useful to speed up combat in Roll20. All of the spells can be customized by modifying the variables at the top of the macro. I created a ToDo.md file and I will cross off spells, abilities and attacks as I finish them.

I think these macros will work best when used by the players only, as this will allow them to have more hands on control over the game, while significantly speeding up combat. However, I won't be making macros for NPCs other than maybe some visual FX. I don't care to add any functions that will change the players character sheet in any way, as I trust my players to manage their own spell slots, hit points, class feats etc and IMHO doing otherwise is detremental to their player agency.

**Custom Status Markers:**
With my macros you can automatically control advantage and disadvantage rolls for saving throws based on two custom token status icons. You will need to create these and add them into your game on the game Launch Screen on the right side you will find a section called 'Token Marker Sets' You will need to create one called 'Advantage' and called 'Disadv'. Placing one of these status icons on a token will cause it to roll with advantage or disadvantage.

Happy dungeon crawling!
